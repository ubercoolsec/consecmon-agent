store them in database with the following info

repo tag
image id (sha256)
hostname
timestamp



trivyScan(imageID string, repoTag string) {
    scan the image using the imageID
    store the output JSON with data, repo tag, hostname, toolversion, timestamp
}

dockleScan(imageID string, repoTag string) {
    scan the image using the imageID
    store the output JSON with data, repo tag, hostname, toolversion, timestamp
}

listRunning(imageID string) {
    list of the images running with this image id
    repo tag, image id, hostname, no of images running, toolversion, imestamp

    in future we can analysis how long it's running
    map when the vulnerabilities came
    how long it was risky
    alert based on new bug
    risk ratting
    etc.
